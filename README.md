# Graph search algorithms in C

## Currently implemented
* Depth-first search
* Breadth-first search
* Dijkstra's algorithm (not optimized, stil slow)

## How to run
### Breadth-first search
```
$make bfs
$./test
```
### Depth-first search
```
$make dfs
$./test
```

### Dijkstra's algorithm
```
$make dijkstra
$./test
```
